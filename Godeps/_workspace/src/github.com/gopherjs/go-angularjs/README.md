Go-AngularJs
------------
A wrapper for [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) to be used with [GopherJS](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs).  

The goal is to create a full-fledged AngularJs framework in Go, this would enable an unprecedented style of website development: write a full website with both client and server side in Go to super safe, fast and smart web app.   
This library is in early stages of development, basic functionalities of Angular already working, but there's still a lot to be implemented.
