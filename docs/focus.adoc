== NAME

focus - an experimental collaboration platform

== SYNOPSIS

[verse]
focus [-h] [-api=<url>] [-bind=<ip>:<port>] [-driver=<driver>]
    [-dsn=<dsn>] [-local=<bool>] [-log=<path>]

== DESCRIPTION

focus is a pre-alpha quality https://etherpad.org[Etherpad] clone.

== OPTIONS

-h::
	Prints online help, including current default values of arguments.

-api=<api>::
	Tells focus to direct JS clients to use '<api>' as their <<intent#CL-3,VPP service locator>>.

-bind=<ip>:<port>::
	Tells focus to bind to '<ip>' on port '<port>'.

-driver=<driver>::
	Tells focus to store data via '<driver>'. Currently, '<driver>' should be 'sqlite'.

-dsn=<dsn>::
	Tells focus to store data in data source '<dsn>'. Correct values of '<dsn>' are '<driver>'-specific. For '-driver=sqlite', '<dsn>' should be a path to a writable file.

-local=<bool>::
	If 'true', tells focus to serve some resources from local files rather than from copies embedded in the 'focus' binary.

-log=<path>::
	Tells focus where to save log records.
