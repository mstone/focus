== Introduction

Per â†‘<<intent#PR-3,PR-3: Operational Transformation Theory>>, focus is based on the theory of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation[operational transformation] (OT), currently as formalized by http://timbaumann.info/[Tim Baumann] in https://github.com/Operational-Transformation/ot.v/blob/master/ListOperation.v[ot.v] and elucidated by http://www.codecommit.com/[Daniel Spiewak] in his essay http://www.codecommit.com/blog/java/understanding-and-applying-operational-transformation["Understanding and Applying Operational Transformation"].

== Idea


The setting for OT is a category whose objects are strings and whose arrows represent edits to strings as particular sequences of simpler terms that represent instructions to a simple automaton to insert, delete, and retain characters taken from the source string.
